This distribution contains the minimial components necessary to build and
distribute an application using CEF on the Linux platform. Please see
the LICENSING section of this document for licensing terms and conditions.


CONTENTS
--------

cmake       Contains CMake configuration files shared by all targets.

include     Contains all required CEF header files.

libcef_dll  Contains the source code for the libcef_dll_wrapper static library
            that all applications using the CEF C++ API must link against.

Release     Contains libcef.so and other components required to run the release
            version of CEF-based applications. By default these files should be
            placed in the same directory as the executable.

Resources   Contains resources required by libcef.so. By default these files
            should be placed in the same directory as libcef.so.


USAGE
-----

Building using CMake:
  CMake can be used to generate project files in many different formats. See
  usage instructions at the top of the CMakeLists.txt file.

Please visit the CEF Website for additional usage information.

REDISTRIBUTION
--------------

This binary distribution contains the below components.

Required components:

The following components are required. CEF will not function without them.

* CEF core library.
  * libcef.so

* Unicode support data.
  * icudtl.dat

* V8 snapshot data.
  * snapshot_blob.bin
  * v8_context_snapshot.bin

Optional components:

The following components are optional. If they are missing CEF will continue to
run but any related functionality may become broken or disabled.

* Localized resources.
  Locale file loading can be disabled completely using
  CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled. The locales directory path can be
  customized using CefSettings.locales_dir_path. 
 
  * locales/
    Directory containing localized resources used by CEF, Chromium and Blink. A
    .pak file is loaded from this directory based on the value of environment
    variables which are read with the following precedence order: LANGUAGE,
    LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES and LANG. Only configured locales need to be
    distributed. If no locale is configured the default locale of "en-US" will
    be used. Without these files arbitrary Web components may display
    incorrectly.

* Other resources.
  Pack file loading can be disabled completely using
  CefSettings.pack_loading_disabled. The resources directory path can be
  customized using CefSettings.resources_dir_path.

  * cef.pak
  * cef_100_percent.pak
  * cef_200_percent.pak
    These files contain non-localized resources used by CEF, Chromium and Blink.
    Without these files arbitrary Web components may display incorrectly.

  * cef_extensions.pak
    This file contains non-localized resources required for extension loading.
    Pass the `--disable-extensions` command-line flag to disable use of this
    file. Without this file components that depend on the extension system,
    such as the PDF viewer, will not function.

  * devtools_resources.pak
    This file contains non-localized resources required for Chrome Developer
    Tools. Without this file Chrome Developer Tools will not function.

* Angle support.
  * libEGL.so
  * libGLESv2.so
  Without these files HTML5 accelerated content like 2D canvas, 3D CSS and WebGL
  will not function.

* SwiftShader support.
  * swiftshader/libEGL.so
  * swiftshader/libGLESv2.so
  Without these files WebGL will not function in software-only mode when the GPU
  is not available or disabled.
